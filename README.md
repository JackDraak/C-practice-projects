C++ Practice Projects
=========
*Enjoy(?) browsing my rookie code base* (and thanks GitHub for the cloudspace!)

Present content includes:
 - IsogramGame : a simple console (text-based) game for one player (built with Visual Studio 2015 IDE) composed of >600 functions
    - features include: 
      - difficulty curve, 
      - toggleable hints, 
      - stats and arbitrary scores, 
      - a mechanism to help track letters played,
      - selectable difficulty levels (fewer/more guesses allowed)
    - future features may include:
    // TODO think of some new features to program, i.e. scoreboard (total # of guesses & points with names? on cloud?)
 
   - Feebback sought:
     - Anything at all, really... 
     - Think a word is too obscure for the game?
     - Think you have a good word to add?
     - Feel "Easy" is too hard, or "Hard" is too easy....
     - Too many / too few guesses allowed for N-length words....
     - What doesn't make sense?

###The Details
Thanks to Ben Tristem (and Udemy.com) for opening some doors for me with the high quality coursework which is the basis for this work.
