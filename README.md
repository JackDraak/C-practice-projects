C++ Practice Projects
=========
*Honestly, I'd keep them private, but can't afford a paid (read: private) repository; 
that as it is, enjoy(?) browsing my rookie code base* (and thanks GitHub for the cloudspace!)

Present content includes:
 - IsogramGame : a simple console (text-based) game for one player (built with Visual Studio 2015 IDE) composed of >600 functions
    - features include: difficulty curve, toggleable hints, stats and score, and a mechanism to help track letters played
    - future features may include:
    // TODO think of some new features to program
 
###The Details
Thanks to Ben Tristem (and Udemy.com) for opening some doors for me with the high quality coursework which is the basis for this work.
